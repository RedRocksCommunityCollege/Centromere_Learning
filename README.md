Collecting and creating code to analyse gene images to assist in diagnostic research. This code will use many different methods to help with preprocessing, postprocessing and diagnostics of health-care images. Included in the platform will be photo editing tools, machine learning pipelines, as well as recommendations for other methods of analysis. It will also include clear methods for determining the viability of all results.
